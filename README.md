# Project-Shiny-Application-and-Reproducible-Pitch

Peer-graded Assignment: Course Project: Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch

Here we use the King County housing data to fit a linear model. This model will be used to predict the value of the house in the county. In this study we will 
be using following features:

•	Waterfront View

•	The House’s Condition

• The number of floors

•	House’s Living Room Area Square-footage

The dataset is gathered from the Kaggle Database.

=====================================================

This peer assessed assignment has two parts.
